For code in Python, let's try and follow [PEP8](https://pybit.es/pep8.html) standards.
For code in R, let's try and follow [the tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

At this stage, everything is a prototype, so feel free to make pull requests and commit directly to the master branch.
